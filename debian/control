Description: FFI-based Lua API for ngx_http_lua_module and/or ngx_stream_lua_module
 This pure Lua library reimplements part of the ngx_lua module's Nginx API for
 Lua with LuaJIT FFI and installs the new FFI-based Lua API into the ngx.* and
 ndk.* namespaces used by the ngx_lua module.
 .
 In addition, this Lua library implements any significant new Lua APIs of the
 ngx_lua module as proper Lua modules, like ngx.semaphore and ngx.balancer.
 .
 The FFI-based Lua API can work with LuaJIT's JIT compiler. ngx_lua's default
 API is based on the standard Lua C API, which will never be JIT compiled and
 the user Lua code is always interpreted (slowly).
